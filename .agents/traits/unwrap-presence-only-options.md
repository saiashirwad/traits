name: unwrap-presence-only-options
purpose: Reduce repeated presence-check scaffolding when the richer Option representation provides no additional value.
subject: Options used only for presence checks and contained-value access.
requirement: "When an Option is used only to check presence and access its
  value, unwrap it with Option.getOrUndefined rather than repeatedly using
  Option.isSome and .value: yield*
  effect.pipe(Effect.map(Option.getOrUndefined)). Access the value directly and
  use explicit undefined checks where strict-boolean linting requires them.
  Retain Option when its combinators or distinction between Some(undefined) and
  None are needed."
applicability: |-
  Applies when using Option only to test presence and access the contained value.
