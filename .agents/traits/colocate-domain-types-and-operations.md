name: colocate-domain-types-and-operations
purpose: Make domain behavior discoverable beside its data model and keep adapters from owning domain logic.
subject: Core domain types and the operations that act on them.
requirement: "Keep each core domain type in its own module and export the
  functions that operate on that type from the same module: TraitExpression.ts
  exports both TraitExpression and check. Consumers such as tool adapters should
  import these definitions rather than defining domain types and their
  operations inline."
applicability: |-
  Applies when introducing or organizing core domain types and their operations.
paths:
  - "*.ts"
  - "*.mts"
  - "*.cts"
