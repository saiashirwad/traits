name: effect-based-exception-handling
purpose: Keep throwable failures in composable Effect error channels with explicit recovery and propagation.
subject: Throwable synchronous operations and Promise failures in application code.
requirement: "Do not use JavaScript try/catch in application code. Model
  throwable synchronous operations with Effect.try and Promise failures with the
  appropriate Effect Promise adapter, then recover with Effect error-handling
  combinators such as catchTags. Handle Effect.try’s actual default error tag
  explicitly: UnknownError in stable Effect 4.0 (rather than the older
  UnknownException name). In React, put such actions in Atom.fn backed by a
  named Effect.fn, not inline component handlers or Atom.fnSync. Preserve
  intentional fallback behavior and let unhandled operational errors propagate."
applicability: |-
  Applies when handling throwable synchronous operations or Promise failures in application code.
