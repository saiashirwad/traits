name: effect-aware-tests
purpose: Keep Effect execution, failures, and resource cleanup under the test framework's lifecycle.
subject: Tests executing Effects or acquiring scoped resources.
requirement: Use @effect/vitest wherever tests execute Effects, yielding Effects
  directly through its Effect-aware test APIs instead of manually calling
  Effect.runSync or Effect.runPromise in ordinary test callbacks. Use the
  installed version's scoped testing support for resource cleanup;
  @effect/vitest 4 provides Scope through it.effect itself. Keep ordinary test
  APIs for pure synchronous tests or framework-specific harnesses that do not
  execute Effects.
applicability: |-
  Applies when writing or updating tests that execute Effects or acquire scoped resources.
