name: shared-layers-at-program-boundaries
purpose: Make dependency ownership and sharing explicit while avoiding repeated construction of program-wide services.
subject: Shared Effect service layer provisioning and dependency scopes.
requirement: "Provide shared, program-wide Effect layers at the outermost
  program boundary, such as the CLI entry point: use
  `program.pipe(Effect.provide(Database.layer))` once rather than
  `query.pipe(Effect.provide(Database.layer))` per call. Inner modules and
  handlers should declare their service dependencies and let the outer layers
  satisfy them, rather than constructing shared layers locally or capturing and
  re-providing those services per call. Keep local provisioning for dependencies
  whose scope or configuration genuinely belongs to that operation."
applicability: |-
  Applies when providing shared Effect service layers or choosing dependency scopes.
  Exception: When every locally provided dependency under assessment has scope or configuration that genuinely belongs to that operation rather than being shared program-wide.
paths:
  - "*.ts"
  - "*.mts"
  - "*.cts"
  - "*.tsx"
